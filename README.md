# Temperature Conversion

I have created a basic **Temperature Conversion** project. The goal of this project was to practice **HTML structure**, **CSS styling**, **responsive design**, and **JavaScript DOM manipulation** by building a small, functional frontend application.

## Features
- Convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit  
- Simple and clean user interface  
- Responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop
